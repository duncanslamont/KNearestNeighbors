This is the clustering algorithm of Duncan Lamont. NYU net Id: DL3833. N#19122868. 
The only code that is not mine is the code in the file Stemmer.java. This was downloaded 
from the official Porter stemmer website:https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/java.txt
This is the only code that is not mine, everything else I made. 

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

Throughout the code there
are various test functions I used to make sure that everything was working correctly.
Many of these functions are commented out, or not explained. Most of the important 
functions I explained their purpose.
