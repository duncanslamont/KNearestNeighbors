This is the KNN algorithm of Duncan Lamont. NYU net Id: DL3833. N#19122868. 

This program uses the latest version of java, I've encountered some errors running it on other machines that do not
have the latest version of java, I'm not sure why.

I used the official Porter stemmer to stem the text files. Website:https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/java.txt
 

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
Go to the folder where the project is contained in terminal. Type:
javac headquarters.java
Then:
java headquarters
It will then prompt you to enter in a file path.

The results are in report.txt, the results of a previous run are in that file now, just in case it doesn't work on your
machine and you want an example.
